            <p>
                I enjoy creating various virtual projects and sharing them with
                others. <br>
                I also like 3D modeling, therefore some of the 3D models I've made will be showcased. <br> 
                Most of my projects were developed on the online game sharing
                platform, Roblox. <br>
                There, I've made various unique projects, including but not
                limited to: <br>
                <br>

                &nbsp &nbsp a unique 2D rendering system, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp Minecraft like terrain generation, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp spring physics simulator, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp unfinished fantasy adventure, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp a winter candy simulator... <br>

                <br>
                I will now share some of these creations (and some other things
                like macros) here.

                Using some known 3D perlin noise generation techniques and some <br>
                fractal brownian motion, I was able to get this kind of terrain <br>
                generation. I also included a culling system which really helps <br>
                when you're using Roblox decals and parts to render the blocks <br>

                This is my first finished game that was made when I actually had <br>
                some skill. With the help of my testers (my friends) I released it <br>
                in December 2023. <br>
                If you'd like to you can play it <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/15341878809/Snow-Blowing-Simulator">here</a>! <br>
