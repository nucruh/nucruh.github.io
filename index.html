            <p>
                I enjoy creating various virtual projects and sharing them with
                others. <br>
                Most of my projects were developed on the online game sharing
                platform, Roblox. <br>
                There, I've made various unique projects, including but not
                limited to: <br>
                <br>

                &nbsp &nbsp a unique 2D rendering system, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp Minecraft like terrain generation, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp spring physics simulator, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp unfinished fantasy adventure, <br>
                &nbsp &nbsp a winter candy simulator... <br>

                <br>
                I will now share some of these creations (and some other things
                like macros) here.

                Uses Roblox image frames -> their positions are modified each frame. <br>
                The grass tile connections simply use a table that contains possible <br>
                connection directions and adjusts the texture accordingly, this gives it <br>
                a unified look. <br>

                Using some known 3D perlin noise generation techniques and some <br>
                fractal brownian motion, I was able to get this kind of terrain <br>
                generation. I also included a culling system which really helps <br>
                when you're using Roblox decals and parts to render the blocks
